# Overview

{This is a Mobile Application, specifically designed for Android. It is a Language Translator App that can perform most translations.}

{My wife and her family speak Spanish and English. Her parents are better with Spanish and I often find myself struggling to keep up with conversations. I created this application to help me quickly translate words they are using that I am unfamiliar with to enhance my relationship and conversation with them. Even though I designed it with English to Spanish in mind, it can translate to and from any other language. It is also useful when traveling to a foreign country.}

# Development Environment

{In order to develop this application I used the Android Studio design environment. Within this environement, I created the ability for the program to draw the languages from google using a google translation API.}

{I used Java to write the bulk of this program. I also used XML to design the layout of the mobile application.}

# Future Work

{Future additions, implementations, or corrections.}
* I would like the program to automatically delete or translate input text when a user changes the desired languages. As of right now, the user has to hit the translate button or manually delete the text.
* Some of the Languages take longer to process when translating to them for the first time. I'd like to find a fix for the latency for first time translation.
* I want to add a Speech to Text button option.
